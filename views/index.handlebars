            <h2>Intuitive</h2>
            <p>A new view for the tasks ahead, breaking down your goal into parts, and allowing you to update their status
                in a simple way.  Create a seperate planner for each project/goal you have going on, and know at-a-glance
                where you stand in regards to completing it.  Display your progress publicly, to your friends, or keep it
                private and to yourself.

            <h2>Teamwork</h2>
            <p>(it makes the dream work.)  Built from the ground up as a collabrative platform.  Add collaborators to your project planner, assigning
                tasks to people, or allowing tasks to be "picked up" as your collaborators see fit. As bullets get checked
                off, progress bars will illustrate just where you stand, and which areas need attention most.
