/*
 *  (Dynamic Planner):
 *      index_style.css - the stylesheet to be referenced by the index.handlebars
 *          render sequence, and will persist throughout any view changes then
 *          made through the DOM (Most of the content the user will see.)
 *      Since this view is so all-encompassing, please use classnames that won't
 *          be used by coincedence in elements you don't intend to style (just
 *          be specific and unambiguous when creating new class names.)  Also,
 *          please dont use ID's unless they have alrady been defined, as I will
 *          require those to be named in convention to the backend code.
 *              Thanks,
 *                  James, aka
 *                  Your fav. backend master, aka
 *                  Your fav. front-end guru, aka
 *                  Gods gift to javascript
 *
 *  UPDATE:  Changed my mind... dont touch anything.
